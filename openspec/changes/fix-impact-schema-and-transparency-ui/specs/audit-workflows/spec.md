## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Epistemic Humility Audit Logic
The `utils_api` microservice SHALL execute deterministic transparency audit functions to reward epistemic humility and operational transparency, utilising the Advanced Check taxonomy (`bonus`, `not_disclosed`, `n_a`).

#### Scenario: Evaluating Negative Impact Disclosure
- **WHEN** the `check_negative_impact_disclosure` function evaluates the `transparency_indicators`
- **THEN** it MUST assign a `bonus` status if `unintended_consequences_reported` is true and verified with a source.
- **AND** it MUST dynamically inject the verbatim `source.quote` into the `details.elaboration` string to ensure the specific admission of failure is surfaced directly to the report user.
- **AND** it MUST assign a `not_disclosed` status if it is false, explicitly noting that non-disclosure is the industry norm and does not constitute a failure.

#### Scenario: Conditionally Evaluating Live Release Rates
- **WHEN** the `check_live_release_transparency` function executes
- **THEN** it MUST first scan the `significant_events` array for `individual_rescue_and_sanctuary` or `veterinary_care_and_treatment`.
- **AND** if neither intervention is present, the audit MUST immediately return an `n_a` (Not Applicable) status with the calculation "Organisation does not engage in direct animal sheltering; metric not applicable."
- **AND** if applicable, it MUST evaluate `euthanasia_statistics_reported`, returning `bonus` for true, and `not_disclosed` for false.
- **AND** if a `bonus` is awarded, it MUST dynamically append the verbatim `source.quote` to the `details.elaboration` string.
