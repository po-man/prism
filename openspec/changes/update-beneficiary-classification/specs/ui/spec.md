## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Animal Beneficiary Badges
The UI SHALL visually categorize the charity's beneficiaries to immediately communicate cause-area neglectedness.

#### Scenario: Selective Rendering of Unspecified Beneficiaries
- **WHEN** rendering the ITN Scorecard or Impact Pathway on an individual organisation's page
- **THEN** the system MUST dynamically render the `unspecified` beneficiary type ONLY if its population is strictly greater than `0`.
- **AND** the original three types (`companion_animals`, `farmed_animals`, `wild_animals`) MUST continue to display by default (in grayscale if their population is 0).

#### Scenario: Hiding Unspecified Beneficiaries in Master Directory
- **WHEN** rendering the "Target Species (Neglectedness)" column in the Master Directory (`index.html`)
- **THEN** the UI MUST strictly evaluate and display only the original three types (`companion_animals`, `farmed_animals`, `wild_animals`).
- **AND** the `unspecified` type MUST remain entirely hidden from this view to preserve the column's comparative focus on EA cause areas, regardless of its population value.
